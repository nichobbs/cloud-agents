# Agent Instructions

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file — keep everything here, don't fork the
content across both. (Fixes the drift that happened before: `AGENTS.md` was
a separate copy of `CLAUDE.md` and silently fell out of sync when only one
got edited.)

## What this repo is

A Lyric application. Lyric is a safety-oriented language targeting .NET 10 (primary) and JVM (Java 21). Syntax is Kotlin/C#/TypeScript-adjacent. It is not TypeScript or Kotlin — read the docs before writing code.

## Build and run

```sh
lyric restore        # fetch [nuget] dependencies (run before build/test)
lyric build          # compile (discovers lyric.toml from any subdir)
lyric run            # build + execute
lyric test           # run all @test_module files
lyric fmt --write    # format in place (opinionated, no config)
lyric lint           # style checks
lyric check          # type-check without emitting artifacts
lyric prove          # SMT verification on @proof_required packages
```

All commands discover `lyric.toml` by walking up from the working directory. No arguments needed from any subdir.

**No released Lyric compiler can currently build, run, check, or test any
Lyric project at all** — a crash inside the compiler itself, confirmed
against a trivial hello-world with no dependencies, across every released
version. This is not specific to this project; see `docs/BUILD.md`
"Compiler notes" and [lyric-lang#4925](https://github.com/nichobbs/lyric-lang/issues/4925)
before assuming a local build failure needs a local fix.

Source files use `.l` extension. Entry point is `func main(): Unit` in the appropriate package.

## Before writing any Lyric code

Read `docs/lyric/reference.md`. It covers syntax, type system semantics, and the things that look like TypeScript/Kotlin but aren't.

Read `docs/lyric/gotchas.md` before making assumptions.

| `docs/lyric/idioms.md` | Canonical patterns — follow these |
| `docs/lyric/gotchas.md` | If something won't compile |
| `src/` | Working code to pattern-match from |
